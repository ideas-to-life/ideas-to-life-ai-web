Building big things starts with building small things. We often get caught up in the "grand vision" and forget that the only way to get there is through iterative steps.

This week, I focused on shipping a single feature instead of trying to architecture the entire system at once. The result? Immediate feedback, faster learning, and a better product.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Ship early**: Don't wait until it's perfect.
2. **Listen to feedback**: Your users know what they need.
3. **Iterate**: Improve based on real-world usage.
