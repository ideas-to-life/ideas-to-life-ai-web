### This week’s focus
This week was shaped by a simple but recurring reminder: the most useful experiments often begin with a very personal, very concrete need. Instead of searching for validation or a polished idea, the focus stayed on solving a real problem I was experiencing myself—and seeing where that could lead.

### What actually happened
The *Idea → Cheat Sheet* experiment didn’t start as a product concept. It started with a practical frustration.

I wanted a fast, structured way to understand how Claude Code actually works—features, commands, patterns, and how to use it day to day. While documentation existed, it was fragmented, not optimised for quick recall, and not something I could easily return to while working.

Rather than hunting for the “best” resource, I decided to create the artefact I wished already existed.

Before building anything, I explored the idea through conversation with ChatGPT—not to validate a business idea, but to articulate the problem clearly, test whether it was worth turning into an experiment, and decide if it fit the Ideas to Life direction. That conversation helped shift the framing from *“this is useful to me”* to *“this is worth exploring publicly.”*

From there, the focus moved deliberately toward repeatability:
- defining a cheat sheet template  
- writing prompt instructions for Claude Code to generate consistent outputs  
- writing prompt instructions for Google Antigravity to add experiments, deploy artefacts, and wire everything into the Ideas to Life site  

Alongside the experiment itself, I invested time in light but intentional documentation—`CLAUDE.md`, `EXPERIMENTS.md`, and `GOOGLE_ADK.md`—not as finished artefacts, but as thinking tools to clarify direction and boundaries.

Finally, I closed the loop by deploying the cheat sheet, linking it as the experiment demo, sharing a small update on LinkedIn, and adding context in GitHub Discussions. No launch narrative, no metrics—just something real, shared deliberately.

### Key trade-offs
- I prioritised **repeatability over polish**, accepting that the first artefact wouldn’t be perfect.
- I chose **conversation over conviction**, delaying decisions until the idea had been pressure-tested through dialogue.
- Time spent on documentation meant fewer visible features, but greater clarity about what could come next.

### What changed in my thinking
This week reinforced that Ideas to Life works best as a *system*, not as a sequence of isolated experiments. Personal pain is still one of the strongest signals for experimentation, but it becomes more powerful when paired with conversation, reflection, and a repeatable execution path.

It also clarified that documentation doesn’t have to be a record of what’s finished—it can be a way to plant stakes for future evolution, including more agentic directions over time.

### Key takeaways
- Personal, concrete needs are often the best starting point for experiments.
- Conversation with AI is most valuable *before* building, not after.
- Repeatability matters more than polish at this stage.
- Documentation can be a thinking tool, not just a record.
- Shipping small artefacts keeps momentum without creating pressure.

### Looking ahead
I want to keep using “how easy is it to do again?” as a filter for new experiments, and continue exploring how small, personal artefacts can evolve into more agentic systems over time.
