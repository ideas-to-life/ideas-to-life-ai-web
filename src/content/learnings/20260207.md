### This week’s focus
Stabilising Runner Agentic Intelligence as a coherent, publishable system by tightening architecture decisions, enforcing a repeatable build process, and reducing UX friction before real user testing.

### What actually happened
- Reworked documentation practice to regenerate AS_BUILT and DELTA_BACKLOG from code and evidence rather than manual edits.
- Reprioritised the roadmap to address LLM abstraction early and validated multi-provider support through regression testing.
- Implemented FIT/FIT.GZ parsing, ingestion validation, SQLite persistence, and chat context injection.
- Iterated extensively on the Gradio demo to introduce guided flows, deterministic outputs, and improved visual structure.
- Deployed the demo to HuggingFace Spaces, resolving multiple deployment and configuration issues along the way.
- Added initial multilingual support (English and Brazilian Portuguese) across UI and LLM outputs.
- Paused new feature work to consolidate evidence, update documentation, and reflect on the overall process.

### Key trade-offs
- Prioritising LLM abstraction delayed some functional fixes but reduced long-term cost and lock-in risk.
- Choosing lightweight heuristics over agentic intent detection traded sophistication for reliability and speed.
- Investing time in UX polish reduced backend progress but significantly improved perceived quality.
- Using HuggingFace Spaces simplified user access while introducing deployment constraints and guardrails.
- Enforcing canonical templates limited flexibility but improved consistency and traceability.

### What changed in my thinking
- Documentation accuracy improves when treated as a generated artefact, not a narrative one.
- LLM prompts and schemas function as architectural contracts, not just tuning tools.
- UX structure and gating can deliver more value than adding new features.
- Early exposure to real users is worth the operational friction it introduces.
- Velocity increases once the process itself is externalised and made repeatable.

### Architecture signals
- LLM abstraction is a first-order architectural concern for consumer-facing systems.
- Deterministic structure in LLM outputs is essential for stable UI composition.
- Local-first persistence with optional cloud exposure is a strong default for early products.
- Explicit state transitions reduce UI complexity and downstream bugs.
- Simple, explicit heuristics often outperform more complex agent designs at this stage.

### Key takeaways
- Treat system documentation as regenerable evidence, not manual prose.
- Lock down process (Issue → Prompt → PR → Evidence) before scaling features.
- Address abstraction and contracts early to avoid compounding technical debt.
- UX clarity can unlock more value than additional intelligence.
- Early deployment surfaces constraints that design-time reasoning misses.

### Assumptions invalidated
- Assumed multilingual support could be layered later without friction; in practice it affected many parts of the system.
- Assumed deployment scripts were low risk; they required the same rigor as application code.

### Looking ahead
- Formalise evidence-capture and consolidation steps in the runbook.
- Add guardrails and pre-flight checks to all deployment automation.
- Expand multilingual support beyond UI into evaluation and prompts.
- Collect real user feedback from the public demo to inform next iterations.
