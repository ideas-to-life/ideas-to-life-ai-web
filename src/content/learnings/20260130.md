### This week’s focus

Shift Ideas-to-Life from a set of individually correct components into a system that is understandable, navigable, and repeatable as a whole.

### What actually happened

I stepped back from individual prompts and repositories and looked at the platform end-to-end. While each piece worked in isolation, the overall sequence and dependencies were difficult to reason about without a shared mental model.

To address this, I introduced a clear separation of concerns across the platform: governance (Experiments Charter), templates (intent), prompts (execution), artefacts (outputs), and the website (rendering and linking). Several prompts were refactored to be single-responsibility, explicitly separating generation from deployment and definition from exposure. Deploy prompts were clarified as never generating artefacts, only wiring existing ones into the system.

I standardised lifecycle vocabulary (exploring → validating → shipping → archived) and promoted EXPERIMENTS.md to a platform-level charter with metadata, treating it as a constitutional artefact rather than documentation. Metadata headers were added consistently to make contracts explicit across templates, prompts, and governance.

A RUNBOOK was created to reduce cognitive load and turn the platform into repeatable muscle memory. In parallel, I iterated on a visual process diagram: an initial version that was technically correct but unusable, a second pass improving readability, and a third version making dependencies and governance explicit through visual cues. This dependency view surfaced how prompts rely on templates and charters in practice.

### Key trade-offs

- Investing time in structure and visualisation over shipping new features.
- Adding upfront constraints and metadata in exchange for reduced ambiguity later.
- Slowing down prompt creation to enforce single responsibility and clearer contracts.
- Treating governance artefacts as first-class system components rather than lightweight notes.

### What changed in my thinking

The feeling of being “lost” was not due to system complexity, but to the absence of a map. Once the system was visualised with clear dependencies and contracts, clarity returned quickly. This reinforced that coherence is less about simplifying components and more about making relationships explicit.

### Key takeaways

- Explicit contracts matter more than individual correctness.
- Visualising dependencies reduces cognitive load faster than simplification.
- Separating intent (templates) from execution (prompts) prevents drift.
- Governance artefacts work best when treated as first-class system components.

### Looking ahead (optional)

Next steps are to validate whether the current structure holds under new experiments, and to observe where the contracts or lifecycle vocabulary need refinement as the platform evolves.
