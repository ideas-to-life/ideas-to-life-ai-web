### This week’s focus

This week focused on evolving and stabilising the Architecture Pattern system so that extraction, transformation, and publication operate as a governed pipeline rather than ad-hoc documentation.

### What actually happened

- Identified incompatibility between the pattern extractor JSON schema and the Pattern Markdown template.
- Extended the extractor schema to include an `agentic_profile` block capturing system shape, orchestration mode, interaction style, tool protocol usage, optimisation targets, and simplicity vs autonomy.
- Introduced explicit use of `unknown` for non-evidenced agentic dimensions and required evidence when marking MCP or tool usage as present.
- Clarified that `agentic_profile` is descriptive metadata, not a gating criterion for pattern validity.
- Updated the transformer prompt to map `agentic_profile` deterministically and avoid implicit multi-agent assumptions.
- Updated the RUNBOOK with Pattern Origins (execution-derived v1), Pattern Lifecycle states, and a formal Pattern Publication Flow (Extractor → Transformer → Review → Publish → Back-reference).
- Added a Definition of Done for pattern publication and reinforced the rule that extraction does not equal publication.
- Explicitly decided to keep the catalogue execution-derived for now and defer curated canonical patterns.
- Confirmed the end-to-end pipeline consistency from codebase extraction to rendered catalogue page.

### Key trade-offs

- Adding agentic dimensions increased structural clarity but risked over-constraining the catalogue to multi-agent patterns.
- Hardening governance reduced ambiguity but added process overhead and corrective alignment work.
- Formalising lifecycle and publication rules improved integrity while slowing immediate pattern publication.
- Extending schemas before clarifying intent required retroactive adjustments to prevent misinterpretation.

### What changed in my thinking

- Architectural metadata must describe context without implicitly enforcing architectural shape.
- Schema alignment across extractor, transformer, template, and runbook is itself a first-class architectural concern.
- Governance layers are necessary to prevent drift in AI-assisted knowledge systems.
- Explicit “unknown” values are safer than silent inference when capturing architectural signals.

### Architecture signals (optional)

- Treat descriptive metadata as contextual, not prescriptive, unless explicitly intended.
- Separate extraction from publication to maintain catalogue integrity.
- Align schema, transformation logic, and rendering templates as a coordinated system.
- Use lifecycle states as guardrails against entropy in evolving knowledge artefacts.

### Key takeaways

- Extraction and publication must be decoupled to protect quality.
- Descriptive architectural metadata should not become implicit constraints.
- Schema changes require coordinated updates across the full toolchain.
- Governance and lifecycle definitions reduce long-term drift.
- “Unknown” is a valid architectural state when evidence is incomplete.

### Looking ahead (optional)

- Introduce lightweight compatibility checks when evolving schemas and templates in parallel.
- Consider adding versioning notes when extractor, transformer, and template evolve together.
- Periodically run an end-to-end test pattern to validate full pipeline integrity after structural changes.
