This week wasn’t about shipping new ideas. It was about stabilising the foundation before scaling experiments.

Most evenings went into fixing an opaque Hugging Face issue on EA4ALL.AI and future-proofing the stack (LangChain, dependencies, architecture).

- The only reliable solution ended up being pragmatic: create a new Space and redeploy — after many hours trying (and failing) to reproduce the issue locally or in other Spaces.
- The root cause was never fully clear, but strong signals point to dependency mismatches between local development (uv) and deployment (pip on Spaces).
Lesson learned: experimentation doesn’t fail only at the idea level — dependency management and environment parity are first-order concerns.
- Used the opportunity to future-proof the stack (LangChain upgrades, package versions, baseline architecture), aiming to reduce friction and technical debt for upcoming experiments and to unlock newer platform capabilities.

Trade-off: no new experiments shipped this week (e.g. Runner AI Intelligence stayed on hold). It was invisible work, but necessary, reducing friction and technical debt so future experiments can move faster.

## Key Takeaways

1. **This week reminded me** that momentum isn’t always visible. 
2. **Building experiments** requires resilience, pragmatic decisions, and a long-term view.
3. **I can’t control every failure mode** — but I can control how I respond.
4. **Today’s work serves the north star** rather than just today’s output.
