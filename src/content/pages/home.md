heroTitle: "Ideas to Life"
heroSubtitle: "A repeatable system to discover, validate, and ship real products."
heroDetails: "This is a disciplined idea-to-production engine focused on solving real problems, shipping to production, and learning fast."
whyTitle: "Why Ideas to Life Exists"
whyText: "Most ideas don’t fail because they’re bad — they fail because there’s no system to turn them into real, usable products. Ideas to Life exists to close that gap with a repeatable, production-minded approach."
whyBullets:
  - "Move from vague problems to clear hypotheses"
  - "Validate demand before overbuilding"
  - "Ship production-ready solutions, not demos"
focusTitle: "What This Is Optimising For"
focusSubtitle: "Clarity over novelty. Outcomes over output."
experimentsTitle: "🧪 Experiments (Not Projects)"
experimentsSubtitle: "Each experiment is a deliberate run through the system — build, validate, ship, learn, or kill."
howTitle: "How the System Works"
howSubtitle: "A simple, repeatable loop designed for sustainable side-building."
howBullets:
  - "Observe real-world problems"
  - "Form clear hypotheses"
  - "Validate demand early"
  - "Build the smallest useful solution"
  - "Ship to production"
  - "Learn, iterate, or kill"
joinTitle: "Follow or Get Involved"
joinText: "If you’re interested in real-world problems, early pilots, or following along as products are built in public, you’re in the right place."
