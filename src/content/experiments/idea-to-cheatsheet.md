# Idea to Cheat Sheet

## Why This Exists
Learning new tools and frameworks often involves jumping between long-form documentation, tutorials, and scattered notes. This experiment explores a lighter alternative: concise, interactive cheat sheets that make it easier to get started and stay productive.

## What This Experiment Explores
Interactive cheat sheets designed to sit between documentation and tutorials:
- Smaller than tutorials
- More actionable than blog posts
- Easier to maintain than full documentation
- Well suited for fast-moving tools (such as AI coding CLIs)

## Key Features
- Clear visual hierarchy for fast scanning
- Search and filter for real usability
- Click-to-copy commands for frictionless reuse
- Categories that reflect real workflows rather than marketing concepts

## Current Status
This experiment is currently in the **Exploring** phase, focusing on layout patterns, interaction design, and reusability across multiple cheat sheets.
