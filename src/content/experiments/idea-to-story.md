# idea-to-story

Writer's block often comes from having a great premise but no clear path forward. **idea-to-story** acts as an infinite co-writer that never gets tired.

## Key Capabilities
- **Plot Expansion**: Turn a one-sentence logline into a full 3-act structure.
- **Character Development**: Generate deep backstories, motivations, and arcs for your characters.
- **World Building**: Create consistent rules, history, and geography for your fictional world.

We are actively using this tool to write the narrative layer for our other experiments.
