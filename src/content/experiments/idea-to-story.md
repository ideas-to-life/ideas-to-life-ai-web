## Why This Exists
Writer's block often comes from having a great premise but no clear path forward. **idea-to-story** acts as an infinite co-writer that never gets tired.

## Key Capabilities
- **Plot Expansion**: Turn a one-sentence logline into a full 3-act structure.
- **Character Development**: Generate deep backstories, motivations, and arcs for your characters.
- **World Building**: Create consistent rules, history, and geography for your fictional world.

## Current Status

This experiment is currently in the **Exploring** phase.
At this stage, it exists as a conceptual exploration rather than a working prototype.
