# idea-to-art

Visualizing thoughts is one of the hardest challenges in creative work. **idea-to-art** removes the friction between the mind's eye and the screen.

## How it works
1. **Concept Extraction**: A semantic analyzer breaks down your textual idea into visual components (style, lighting, composition).
2. **Style Transfer**: We apply curated artistic styles (from "Cyberpunk Noir" to "Oil Painting") to the base concept.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: You can tweak specific elements (e.g., "make it darker", "add neon lights") without regenerating the entire image.

This experiment is currently powering our internal marketing material.
