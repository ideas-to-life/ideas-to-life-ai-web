## Why This Exists
Language learning apps are often repetitive. **Fluency Quest** turns learning into an adventure where the narrative evolves based on your progress and choices.

## Concept
- **Dynamic Dialogue**: Converse with AI characters in the target language.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The complexity of the language scales with your ability.

## Current Status
**Exploring** user journeys, gamification options, mechanics of real-time narrative adaptation and speech recognition latency.
