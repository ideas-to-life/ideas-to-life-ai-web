# EA4ALL.AI

## Why This Exists
Enterprise Architecture is often seen as an ivory tower discipline. **EA4ALL** aims to democratize it by using AI to generate models, diagrams, and strategic insights from unstructured data.

## Vision
To make strategic alignment accessible to every organization, regardless of size or budget.

## Current Status
This experiment is in the **Validating** phase. We are testing the core generation capabilities with sample datasets.
