## Why This Exists
Enterprise Architecture teams struggle with limited resources, fragmented processes, and poor collaboration between business and technology. They remain reactive and slow to adapt, hindered by manual work, knowledge silos, and a steep learning curve.

- Lack of shared understanding between business and technology stakeholders.
- Slow, manual, and fragmented architecture documentation processes.
- Inability to quickly adapt architecture to strategic or market changes.
- Limited collaboration and accessibility of architectural knowledge.
- Steep learning curve and delayed exposure to proven design patterns.
- Architecture teams constrained by Enterprise Technology budget (small teams)
- Project oriented and reactive architecture teams

## Vision
Empower people with ability to harness the value of Enterprise Architecture with Generative AI to positively impact individuals and organisations.

## What This Experiment Explores

- `Empower individuals with Knowledge`: understand and talk about Business and Technology strategy, IT landscape, Architectue Artefacts in a single click of button.
- `Accelerate learning`: gain quick access to new architectures design, patterns, and best-practices. 
- `Increase efficiency and productivity`: generate a documented architecture with diagram, model and descriptions. Accelerate Business Requirement identification and translation to Target Reference Architecture. Automated steps and reduced times for task execution.
- `Improve agility`: plan, execute, review and iterate over EA inputs and outputs. Increase the ability to adapt, transform and execute at pace and scale in response to changes in strategy, threats and opportunities.
- `Increase collaboration`: democratise architecture work and knowledge with anyone using natural language.
- `Cost optimisation`: intelligent allocation of architects time for valuable business tasks.
- `Business Growth`: create / re-use of (new) products and services, and people experience enhancements.
- `Resilience`: assess solution are secured by design, poses any risk and how to mitigate, apply best-practices.
- `Streamline`: the process of managing and utilising architectural knowledge and tools in a user-friendly way.

## Current Status
This experiment is in the **Validating** phase and continuous evolution exploring new architecture patterns and capabilities with sample datasets.
