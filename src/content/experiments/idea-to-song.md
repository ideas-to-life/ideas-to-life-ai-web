# idea-to-song

This experiment explores the boundary between human emotion and algorithmic composition. By providing a simple prompt or a specific mood, our system orchestrates multiple AI agents to generate melodies, harmonies, and arrangements that capture the essence of the original idea.

## Key Features
- Emotion-to-melody mapping
- Multi-instrument orchestration
- Real-time generation feedback loops
