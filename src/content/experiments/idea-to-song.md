# idea-to-song

## Why This Exists
This experiment explores the boundary between human emotion and algorithmic composition.

## What This Experiment Explores
By providing a simple prompt or a specific mood, our system orchestrates multiple AI agents to generate melodies, harmonies, and arrangements that capture the essence of the original idea.

## Key Features
- Emotion-to-melody mapping
- Multi-instrument orchestration
- Real-time generation feedback loops

## Current Status
We are **Exploring** the use of multi-agent orchestration for complex musical composition.
